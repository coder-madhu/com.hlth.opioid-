SubArray or sub String problems
 
  How to find the problems
 -	 well sutiable for the iterable items
 		things we iterate over sequentially
 			concerned with contiguous sequence of elements
 			String, Arrays, Linkedlist
 	min max longest, shortest contained
 		- may be we need to calculated some thing
 		
 Questons Variant 
  
 Fixed Length
 	max sum sub array of size k
 Dynamic Variant
 	Smallest sum gereater than or equal to SomeValue S
 Dynamic Variant with Auxiallary Data structure
 	(using maps,hash set, addl array etc, like boolean..)
 		find the longest substring with not more than k distinct characters (using hashmap or hashset)
 String permutations
 
 what is the commanalaties
 - everything is grouped sequentially
 - every thing is specified to some sequential criteraia (key words- smallest, longest, contains, maximize, minimize)
