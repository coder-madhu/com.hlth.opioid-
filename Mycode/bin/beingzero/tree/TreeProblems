Depth of the tree
Height of the tree
Height of the node
depth of the node
Preorder-( Root-left-Right)
inorder- ( left-Root-Right)
PostOrder- ( left-Right-Root)
predecessor -immediate previous node of the node in inorder traversal of the binary tree
Successor-immediate next node of the node in inorder traversal of the binary tree

BT: each node has 0/1/2 child (never more than 2)
family of the data structure of the BT are BST, Heap Tree, AVL, red black, syntax, tree, huffman coding etc..
-- used to solve specific prolems
	huffmancoding
	heap (Priority Queue)
	expression parsing
	
Strict BT- each node has either 2 or none
Full BT-  each non leaf nodes has 2 child and all leaf nodes are at same level
complete BT (all leves are completely filled and except last level and last level keys should be left as possible (no right node if unfilled))


Array- storage no zero index used
	x= parent
	left = 2x
	right= 2x+1
